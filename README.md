## RemarkPortable

A simple and portable way of using **[Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)**, that doesn't require an internet connection. Decluttered `index.html` to make it easier to get an overview.

Also included all necessary files in the repo for easy setup after downloading / cloning.

***Note: I'd personally recommend that you use [Display](https://github.com/BenStigsen/Display) instead, as that is about ~350x lighter (Display is ~2 KB, RemarkPortable is ~700 KB), easier to customize and under active development.***

### Getting Started

1. Download or clone this repo (you can also use the **[releases](https://github.com/BenTearzz/RemarkPortable/releases)** page).
2. Write your markdown in the `<textarea>` in `index.html` or in a local file.
3. That's it... now you just open `index.html` in a browser, click `load` and it should work.

---

When opening `index.html`, there'll be two buttons. One to load the HTML content currently in `textarea` and one to open up a local file and use that for presentations. Both buttons will dissappear when entering fullscreen.

---

For customization you can customize `style.css` to your needs. More customization options can be found on the **[Remark Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Formatting)**.
